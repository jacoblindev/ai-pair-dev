A minimal, junior-friendly workflow for shipping with a Product Requirements Document (PRD) → Task generation → Task processing. The core rules live in three markdown files.

## Start Here

- Read `AGENTS.md` for the overview and rhythm.
- Follow the rules in:
  - `rules/create-prd.md`
  - `rules/generate-tasks.md`
  - `rules/process-task-list.md`

## Docs Layout
