# Tasks — Sample Feature

## Assessment Snapshot

- Repo tree: describe relevant directories/modules.
- Stack: commands for build/test/lint.
- Risks: known debt, blockers, or dependency concerns.
- Links: related ADRs or portfolio log entries.

## Parents

- [ ] 0.0 Establish architecture scaffolding
  - [ ] 0.1 Create directory layout & stubs from PRD Module Plan
  - [ ] 0.2 Align code with ARCH boundaries; add/update ADR if deviating
  - [ ] 0.3 Reconfirm dependency expectations (ADR required for new runtime deps)

- [ ] X.0 Align & prune tests
  - [ ] X.1 Retire tests mismatching updated requirements (same PR)
  - [ ] X.2 Add/adjust tests for new public behavior only
  - [ ] X.3 Keep test runtime within agreed budget

## Sub‑Tasks

- [ ] Implement Domain Policy A
  - Acceptance: Tests cover the public behavior; imports respect `ARCH-v1`; ADR filed for any runtime dependency; portfolio log updated if cross-product impact.
  - Traceability: PRD §Acceptance Criteria #, ARCH §Module Map, ADR-0001.
